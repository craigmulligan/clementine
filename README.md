# Express Postgres Starter

> A starter project for Node.js with Express and Postgres

## Setup

Pre-requisites:

- Docker for Desktop

Run `docker-compose up` in the root of the project.

It will bring up Postgres and the Express application server in development mode.

It binds the application server to `localhost:3000`, this can be re-mapped this by changing the first 3000 in `3000:3000` of [./docker-compose.yaml](./docker-compose.yaml)).

Postgres is exposed on port `35432`. The connection string is `postgres://user:pass@localhost:35432/db` (username, password and database name are defined in [./docker-compose.yaml](./docker-compose.yaml)).

You can connect to Postgres using the psql client:

```sh
psql postgres://user:pass@localhost:35432/db
```

The default Docker `CMD` is `npm start`, [./docker-compose.yaml](./docker-compose.yaml) overrides this to `npm run dev` which runs the application using nodemon (auto-restart on file change).


## Express API setup

The Express API is located in [./src/api](./src/api).

Applications routes for resources are defined in [./src/api/index.js](./src/api/index.js).

Global concerns like security, cookie parsing, body parsing and request logging are handled in [./server.js](./server.js).

This application loosely follows the [Presentation Domain Data Layering](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/PresentationDomainDataLayering.html):

- Presentation is dealt with in the `./src/api` folder
- Domain is dealt with in the `./src/modules` folder. It's currently non-existent since we've only got generic user and session resources.
- Data is dealt with in the `./src/persistence` folder

## Database setup + management

`npm run migrate up` will run the migrations.

`npm run migrate down` will roll back the migrations.

`npm run migrate:create <migration-name>`  will create a new migration file in [./src/migrations](./src/migrations).

To run the migrations inside of docker-compose. Which will run a bash instance inside the `app` container.
```sh
docker-compose run app bash
```

Followed by:
```sh
npm run migrate up
```

## Session/Authentication management

Session management is done through a custom sessions table, `/api/session` endpoints (see [./src/api/session.js](./src/api/session.js)) and leveraging [client-sessions](https://github.com/mozilla/node-client-sessions).
